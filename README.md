# Job Portal

Job Portal is a MERN Stack based web app which helps in streamlining the flow of job application process. It allows users to select there roles (applicant/recruiter), and create an account. In this web app, login session are persistent and REST APIs are securely protected by JWT token verification. After logging in, a recruiter can create/delete/update jobs, shortlist/accept/reject applications and edit profile. And, an applicant can view jobs, perform fuzzy search with various filters, apply for jobs with an SOP, view applications, edit profile. Hence, it is an all in one solution for a job application system.But there is still a problem regarding Resume Builder that a applicant can't upload Resume Yet.
